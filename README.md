# Graph a Day - Climate, Nature, and Environmental Data

Welcome to Graph a Day! This is a project where I'll be creating and sharing a graph every day related to climate, nature, or environmental data. The goal is to improve my data visualization skills while also sharing interesting information with others.

## How it Works

Every day, I'll create a new graph using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and numpy. I'll then publish the graph to Twitter along with a link to the corresponding folder in this GitHub repository. You can follow along with the project by searching for the hashtag [#graphaday](insert_your_hashtag_here) on Twitter.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python, pandas, matplotlib, and numpy installed on your computer. You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```


Once you have these libraries installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and start exploring the graphs.

## Folder Structure

The graphs are organized by date in the `graphs` folder. Each folder contains the code used to generate the graph as well as the graph image itself. You can also find the data used for each graph in the corresponding folder.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for data sources or ideas for graphs, feel free to open an issue or pull request on this repository. I'm always looking for new ideas and feedback!
